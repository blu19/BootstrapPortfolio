                <p>
                    Welcome everyone! I look forward to meeting you if I haven't already. 
                    My name is Brian Ulatowski and this is my first basic portfolio website. 
                    I graduated from Cal State University Northridge in 2005 with a BA in 
                    Liberal Studies and a focus in teaching math and a Teaching Credential. 
                    I have taught for 14 years, in public and private schools, including charter 
                    schools and internationally in Cambodia, Vietnam and Costa Rica. I've taught 
                    mostly math subjects, but have also taught English as a Second Language, 
                    History, Language Arts, Science, Humanities, as well as other stuff. 
                    Currently, I'm taking a full stack web development program via Trilogy at 
                    UCLA Extension. My hope is that I can transition into a career in web 
                    development.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When I'm not working, I enjoy spending time with family and friends, 
                    especially my wife. I enjoy traveling to different places, especially 
                    places that speak different languages and have different cultures than 
                    what we are used to here in the US. I've had the privilege of traveling 
                    through more than 25 different countries. Usually budget travel. Once flew 
                    round trip to Guatemala from Los Angeles for $72 including tax. I've been 
                    turned down for a job because I didn't look 'American enough.' I've moved 
                    a lot more than most; more times than years I've been alive. I do my best 
                    to stay active and get in exercise several times each week, as it helps me 
                    to maintain my sanity. I'm extremely afraid of heights. I am a very picky 
                    eater, but I love to eat and I also love to cook, but my actual cooking 
                    skills are still progressing. I enjoy watching movies and shows, especially 
                    realistic dramas or comedies. I care about people and the community around 
                    me. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    This hopefully gives you a little insight to me. Please feel free to reach 
                    out to ask me any questions about myself or web development stuff.
