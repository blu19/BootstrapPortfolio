                <p>
                    Welcome everyone! I look forward to meeting you if I haven't already.
                    My name is Brian Ulatowski and this is my portfolio website. I graduated from 
                    Cal State University Northridge in 2005 with a BA in Liberal Studies with a 
                    focus in teaching math and a Teaching Credential. Since then, I have taught 
                    for over 10 years, in public and private schools, including charter schools 
                    and internationally in Cambodia, Vietnam and Costa Rica. I've taught mostly 
                    math subjects, but have also taught English as a Second Language, History, 
                    Language Arts, Science, Humanities, as well as other stuff. Currently, I'm 
                    taking a full stack web development program via Trilogy at UCLA Extension. My 
                    plan is to transition into a career in web development.
                </p>

                <p>
                    When I'm not working, I enjoy spending time with family and friends,
                    especially my wife. I enjoy traveling to different places, especially
                    places that speak different languages and have different cultures than
                    what I am used to here in the US. I've had the privilege of traveling
                    through more than 25 different countries. Usually budget travel. Once flew
                    round trip to Guatemala from Los Angeles for $72 including tax. I've been
                    turned down for a job because I didn't look 'American enough.' I've moved
                    a lot more than most; more times than years I've been alive. I do my best
                    to stay active and get in exercise several times each week, as it helps me
                    to maintain my sanity. I'm extremely afraid of heights. I am a very picky
                    eater, but I love to eat and I also love to cook, but my actual cooking
                    skills are still progressing. I enjoy watching movies and shows, especially
                    realistic dramas or comedies. I care about people and the community around
                    me.
                </p>

                <p>
                    This hopefully gives you a little insight to me. Please feel free to reach
                    out to ask me any questions about myself or web development stuff.
                </p>
